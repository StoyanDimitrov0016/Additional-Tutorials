This repository is dedicated to storing various tutorials and courses I've taken to improve my coding skills, particularly in HTML, CSS, and front-end technologies. As a beginner, I'm focused on building a strong foundation in these areas, which will help me with more advanced topics like DOM manipulation. The goal of this repository is to keep all of my side courses organized in one place, and to avoid cluttering my main projects repository. Future courses will also be added as needed. Thanks for checking it out!
